Here are the most notable signals from the latest TechPulse MegaMap scan:

- **xAI**, valued at $70B (as of July 1), remains a key player to watch with its rumored agent-driven infrastructure and autonomous web layer.
- **Thinking Machines Lab** ($10B valuation) is expanding its role in enterprise LLM deployment and data-to-insight pipelines.
- **Harvey.ai** ($5B), known for its legal agent copilots, is rapidly diversifying into regulated verticals like compliance and healthcare.

These companies represent **the next layer of enterprise-AI abstraction**: instead of building foundational models, they’re embedding LLMs into domain-specific workflows — legal ops, data analytics, and developer tooling.

> These trends suggest continued venture appetite for **applied AI plays**, especially those leveraging multi-agent or human-in-the-loop architectures.
