### What happened:

Pano AI raised $44M Series B led by Giant Ventures, bringing its total to $89M. This builds on four years of success—serving 250+ first-responder agencies, 15 utilities, and covering ~30M acres across the U.S., Canada, and Australia.

### Why it matters:

Pano blends high-resolution panoramic cameras with deep-learning algorithms, real-time smoke detection, and human analyst verification to reduce false alarms—deploying in remote, high-risk environments.

### What to watch:

1. **Scaling government & utility contracts** — Pano aims for strong partnerships based on demonstrated ROI.  
2. **Expanding global footprint** — especially across Europe and South America, where wildfire seasons are intensifying.  
3. **Tech depth** — integrating satellite data, IoT sensors, and AI enhancements to further reduce false positives.
