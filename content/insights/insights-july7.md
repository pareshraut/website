<h3>Agentic AI & Automation</h3>
<p>
  The agentic AI space continues to evolve rapidly with both opportunity and risk unfolding in parallel. This week, <strong>Tolan</strong>, a next-gen AI companion, launched to wide attention. Positioned not as a tool, but as a personalized AI "friend," Tolan exemplifies a growing class of AI interfaces designed to provide both utility and emotional engagement.
</p>
<p>
  At the same time, cautionary tales emerge. <em>WIRED</em> reports how free AI tools were co-opted by a pro-Russian disinformation campaign, raising red flags around agentic AI's accessibility and misuse.
