AI progress is colliding with environmental urgency. In a high-profile sustainability maneuver, **Meta inked a deal to power its AI systems with geothermal energy**. While this is a positive signal, Metaâ€™s own sustainability report reveals a troubling contradiction: **AI workloads are also driving up emissions.**

Microsoft and Google show similar trends â€” their climate goals are being undermined by the energy intensity of LLM training and inference operations.

Whatâ€™s the takeaway for startups and investors? Thereâ€™s a gap in the market for **climate-aligned AI infrastructure** â€” think cooling systems, model optimization APIs, and decentralized data centers. Meanwhile, VCs may find attractive returns in startups offering **clean compute resources or emissions tracking tools for AI-native businesses.**
